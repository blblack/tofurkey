.SH NAME
tofurkey \- Distributed sync for TCP Fastopen key rotations
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtofurkey\fR [-vVno] [-T n] [-P /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen_key]
         [-i seconds] [-a /auto/key/filename] [-k /path/to/main/secret]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtofurkey\fR is a simple daemon which manages the timely,
synchronized, deterministic rotation of TCP Fastopen (TFO) keys across a
cluster of Linux machines.  Keys are set via the Linux 5.10+ procfs
interface for dual keys in \fI/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fastopen_key\fR.

In order to synchronize across a cluster, it requires as input a
long-term main secret key file which is shared across the cluster (by
you and/or your configuration/secret management system), set via the
`-k` argument.

If this is not supplied, a random secret will be auto-generated and
persisted to the (reboot-volatile) rundir by default, which will allow
for local TFO key rotation without any synchronization or reboot
persistence.  A warning will be issued to stderr at startup in this
case, as it's not expected to be a common operating mode in production.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-k\fR
Path to long-term main secret file.  Without this, the daemon will
attempt to persist an automatic key to the rundir on startup, but
this affords no possibility of distribute sync across a cluster, and
may be regenerated after e.g. reboots as well. This file must have
exactly 32 bytes of secret binary data, and will be re-read every
time runtime TFO keys are generated!
.P
.TP
\fB-a\fR
Filename to persist an auto-generated key, if -k is not used.
Defaults to \fI/run/tofurkey.autokey\fR
.P
.TP
\fB-i\fR
Interval seconds for key rotation, default is 21600 (6 hours),
allowed range is 10 - 604800, must be even (daemon wakes up to rotate
keys at every half-interval of unix time to manage validity overlaps)
.P
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Verbose output to stderr
.P
.TP
\fB-n\fR
Dry-run mode - Data is not actually written to procfs, but everything
else still happens
.P
.TP
\fB-o\fR
One-shot mode - it will calculate the current keys and set them once
and then exit. (normal mode is to remain running and rotate keys on
timer intervals forever)
.P
.TP
\fB-V\fR
Verbose and also print TFO keys (mostly for testing, this leaks
short-term secrets to stderr!)
.P
.TP
\fB-P\fR
Override default procfs output path for setting keys (mostly for
testing)
.P
.TP
\fB-T\fR
Set a fake unix time value which never changes (mostly for testing,
min value 1000000)
