1.0.0 - 2024-01-24
    * Minor build improvements (dependencies, rundir stuff)
    * Minor code/documentation refactors/improvements
    * Example systemd unit gained a Documentation line and Restart=on-failure
    * Switching to semver-style versioning from here forward and calling it
      "stable".

0.9 - 2024-01-23
    * Minor fixup to Makefile CPPFLAGS handling, so that critical defines are
      not lost when package build systems set their own CPPFLAGS.

0.8 - 2024-01-23
    * Made "-k" optional rather than required.  When -k is not specified, the
      daemon attempts to auto-generate a local random key and persist it to
      the run directory for future use.  This mode of operation is only useful
      to get smoothly rotated keys on a single host; it cannot help you with
      synchronization across a cluster.
    * New option "-a" allows overriding the default path the autokey is stored
      to on disk (no effect if -k is used).
    * Moved the default installation directory for the main binary to
      /usr/sbin instead of /usr/bin
    * Updated example systemd unit to use sbin and no arguments, which means
      default autokeying.  This allows it to be deployed from distro packaging
      successfully without human intervention to e.g. deploy a real key.

0.7 - 2024-01-22
    * The slow tests (make test SLOW_TESTS=1) now utilize a small python script
      and the python nacl module to actually validate the calculated TFO keys
      and their timing.
    * The example systemd unit now has After=time-sync.target
    * Some of the -v verbose output is less-verbose than before
    * The format of the leaky verbose lines with keys in them changed slightly
      (it now includes the generation time)
    * The daemon now outputs at least one line noting the time every time a new
      set of keys is generated, even in non-verbose mode.
    * Internal refactoring for code clarity

0.6 - 2024-01-19
    * Added a basic manpage
    * A few documentation improvements
    * Makefile improvements, hopefully helps packaging

0.5 - 2024-01-18
    * Disallow setting an odd number as a custom interval value, as this
      would slowly make a mess of the half-interval periodic timer.

0.4 - 2024-01-18
    * Added github workflow to run basic make check on ubuntu-latest
    * Included the commit with the updated testsuite data to match KDF
      ctx change mentioned below (oops!).

0.3 - 2024-01-18
    Mostly internal refactoring, but also changed the KDF context value
    to be the program name.  This seems more-correct, but it is a
    breaking change for key compatibility, so may as well push it out as
    a new release quickly (we're still on day 1 here, don't sue me!).

0.2 - 2024-01-18
    Added support for systemd type=notify, to ensure dependent services
    can rely on the keys being initially set before they start. No new
    build dependencies, and does nothing if NOTIFY_SOCKET env var is not
    set by systemd.  Updated example unit file to match as well.

0.1 - 2024-01-18
    Initial release
