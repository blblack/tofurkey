0.4 - 2024-01-18
    * Added github workflow to run basic make check on ubuntu-latest
    * Included the commit with the updated testsuite data to match KDF
      ctx change mentioned below (oops!).

0.3 - 2024-01-18
    Mostly internal refactoring, but also changed the KDF context value
    to be the program name.  This seems more-correct, but it is a
    breaking change for key compatibility, so may as well push it out as
    a new release quickly (we're still on day 1 here, don't sue me!).

0.2 - 2024-01-18
    Added support for systemd type=notify, to ensure dependent services
    can rely on the keys being initially set before they start. No new
    build dependencies, and does nothing if NOTIFY_SOCKET env var is not
    set by systemd.  Updated example unit file to match as well.

0.1 - 2024-01-18
    Initial release
